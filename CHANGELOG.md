## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added
- Duplicate tenant check — a second, independent tool: `unitprep-dedup`
  (new workspace crate — grouping/comparison/typo-variant domain logic,
  depending only on `unitprep-core`, no session/HTTP/export concerns)
  plus its own session type and three endpoints, `POST /dedup/check`,
  `POST /dedup/report`, `POST /dedup/export`. Every typo/name-variant
  candidate is surfaced for human confirmation, never auto-merged.
  Domain logic verified against real facility exports, byte-for-byte
  matching an independently-confirmed reference-script run on one of
  them.
- CSV parsing now tolerates a trailing unnamed column beyond the
  header's last field (a real, consistent quirk in some facility
  export tools) instead of rejecting every row of an affected file.
- Startup log now includes the process's PID, so a specific running
  instance can be identified from its own log output without a
  separate `ps`/`ss` lookup.

### Changed
- UnitGroup's own domain logic (discovery-result/validation-result
  data, batch building, fingerprint matching, validation rules,
  correction overlays) moved out of the binary's `src/domain/` into the
  previously-empty `unitprep-unit-group` crate — the same
  domain/session boundary `unitprep-dedup` established, applied back to
  the original tool. `Session`/`WorkflowStage`/`StageError` (the stage
  machine) stay in the binary, in `src/application/unit_group_session.rs`.
  No behavior change — verified via the full existing test suite (moved
  intact, none lost) and a live run of the full
  upload/discover/validate/analyze/export pipeline.
- Calling an endpoint before the session has reached the required
  workflow stage (e.g. `/analyze` before `/validate`) now returns
  `409 Conflict` with a structured `{ error, message }` body, instead of
  a fake all-zero `200` success that looked identical to a real,
  successful "nothing to report" result. Every error response across
  the API now shares this same `{ error, message }` shape.
- `POST /group-file/select` now returns the same structured error shape
  as the rest of the API instead of a `200` with `{ success: false }`:
  `409 Conflict` if called before discovery has completed, `400 Bad
  Request` (`group_file_invalid`) if the named file wasn't one
  discovery actually found.
- `POST /session/cancel` stays intentionally idempotent (always `200`,
  even for an unknown session id — that's not an error worth surfacing)
  but its response now includes `deleted: bool`, so a caller that does
  care can tell "deleted a real session" apart from "there was nothing
  there," without changing the success contract.

### Fixed
- `/discover` no longer gets permanently stuck when zero master group
  files are found — the exact shape of a net-new client with nothing
  in QMS yet to cross-reference against. `ready` previously required
  `group_files.len() == 1`, so zero candidates was treated the same as
  "ambiguous, needs selection," except with no candidates to select
  from — a real dead end with no way to proceed. Analysis already
  handled a missing reference set correctly (every discovered group
  becomes net-new); only the discovery-readiness gate was wrong. Zero
  or one candidate is now ready; only *more than one* still requires
  `/group-file/select`. `DiscoverResponse` also now includes
  `discovered_group_names` — the distinct UnitGroup values found across
  the discovered unit files (reusing `build_batch_from_documents`) — so
  the UI can show the user what was actually found before they commit
  to validate/export, most useful exactly when there's no master file
  to cross-check against yet.
- Starting a second instance against an already-bound port used to
  panic with a bare "Address already in use" and no next step. It now
  exits cleanly with a message pointing at the command to find the
  other process (`ss -ltnp | grep :PORT` or `lsof -i :PORT`) — the
  actually useful fact (which *other* process holds the port) isn't
  something this process can look up about itself, so the fix points at
  how to find it rather than guessing at a PID.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- Validation issues now report the specific affected unit ids and a
  human-readable detail string, not just a count.
- `POST /correct` — applies a single corrected value to a flagged unit
  (e.g. Width) as a session-level overlay and immediately re-validates,
  without needing a full re-upload.
- `POST /exempt-dimensions` — marks a catalog entry that legitimately
  isn't a dimensioned unit (an office, an owner's apartment, etc.) as
  exempt from the "Invalid dimensions" check, instead of requiring a
  fabricated Width/Length.
- `POST /export` accepts `acknowledge_errors` — an explicit human
  override to export despite unresolved validation errors, logged when
  used. Never applied silently.
- Real parsing support for Excel 2003 SpreadsheetML XML, content-sniffed
  regardless of file extension (some facility export tools mislabel this
  format with a `.xls` extension).
- Every session-scoped endpoint now returns a distinct
  `404 Session not found or expired` instead of silently faking a
  zero-value success response.
- `HOST`/`PORT` env vars for the bind address; defaults to `0.0.0.0`
  instead of `127.0.0.1` so the app is reachable from outside a
  container by default.
- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var to configure allowed origins beyond the
  local dev defaults.
- `version` field on `GET /health`, read from `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`.
- Endpoint-level test coverage (`src/api/*.rs`) for every new endpoint
  and the session-not-found behavior, alongside the existing domain-level
  unit tests.

### Changed
- "Invalid dimensions or area values" simplified to "Invalid
  dimensions" — Area is no longer validated or offered as a correctable
  field.
- Default logging verbosity reduced from per-file `DEBUG` noise to
  aggregate `INFO` summaries per pipeline stage; `RUST_LOG` now actually
  controls the level instead of being force-overridden to `debug`.

### Removed
- The "Area does not match width × length" validation check — Area is a
  derived value (Width × Length), not an independent fact worth
  validating or correcting on its own.
